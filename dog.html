                <h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
                <p> A thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in
                    packs,
                    pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses.
                    Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's
                    almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their
                    powerful but seemingly effortless gait.</p>

                <h2>Czechoslovakian Wolfdog</h2>
                <p> The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a wolf-dog breed that was bred for police, military and special
                    forces work, conducted in Czechoslovakia in 1955.

                    After initially breeding working line German Shepherds with Carpathian grey wolves, a plan was
                    worked out to create a breed that would have the temperament, pack mentality, and trainability of
                    the German Shepherd and the strength, physical build and stamina of the Carpathian wolf. The breed
                    were originally used as Border patrol dogs but were later also used in search and rescue, Schutzhund
                    sport, tracking, herding, agility, obedience, hunting, and drafting in Europe and the United States.

                <h2>German Shepherd Dog</h2>
                <p> The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium
                    to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German
                    herding dogs from 1899.

                    It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other
                    types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work and warfare. It is
                    commonly kept as a companion dog.
